<div id="choose" class="sticky"><h3 style="color:#2B2B2B;">1 ✧ choose°˖
</h3>
</div>

<p>
    the first step in creating your own display font is to choose... </p> 
<p>let your mind run free and choose a material to work with</p>

<p>what has recently peaked your interest?</p>
    
<p>i invite you to use a pen and paper to write down as many responses as possible to the following prompts (or your own prompts)</p>

<h5>prompts:</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>choose your material</li>
        <li>what has inspired you lately?</li>
        <li>liquid, solid, or gas?</li>
        <li>what material surrounds you these days?</li>
        <li>are you reading a book that references certain material?</li>
        <li> create a mind maps</li>
        <li>list word associations to current fixations/ interests/ obsessions </li>
        <li>what materials are connected to these things? </li>
        <li>do not think about what could be turned into a font; just think about what materials and things are related to your interests
            [colours, shapes, sounds, textures...]</li>
    </ul>
     
    <h5>water experiment:</h5>

    <p>
        i chose to work with water as my material. i was inspired by the 8th poem from the Tao Teh Ching, a Chinese classic text and foundational work of Taoism from roughly 4th century BC
    </p>

    <h5>poem:</h5>
        
    <p>
    “The highest form of goodness is like water.<br>
        Water knows how to benefit all things without striving with them.<br><br>
        It stays in places loathed by all men.<br>
        Therefore, it comes near the Tao.” <br><br>
        (Tao Teh Ching, 8)
    </p>

    <h5>disclaimer:</h5> 
    
    <p>
    remove all preconceived notions of what your font will look like. do not have a final product in mind. if you have expectations, break up with them. i am warning you now that you will not make a font that you can currently imagine. following this method is meant to bring you to wildly unexpected outcomes.<br><br>
    </p>

<div id="create" class="sticky"><h3 style="color:#2B2B2B;">2 ✧ create°˖
</h3>
</div>

<p>without hesitation, immediately after brainstorming, you will attempt to create as many letter forms as possible using your recent choices
</p>

<h5>water experiment:</h5>

    <p>
        since the poem i was interested was about water, i chose to try to "capture" water. i covered my cheap scanner in saran wrap, poured a drop of water on the flatbed, and used my finger to trace the shape before scanning it in.
    </p>

<div id="capture" class="sticky"><h3 style="color:#2B2B2B;">3 ✧ capture°˖
</h3>
</div>

<p>
    once a project evolves from the chaos of the previous step, you may document using any type of capturing method    </p>
<ul>
    <li>scanner</li>
    <li>flash photography</li>
    <li>thermal receipt printer</li>
    <li>fax machine</li>
</ul>

<h5>water experiment:</h5>

<p>since this is a fluid process, my experiments "create" and "capture" phases flowed into one another. scanning my letter forms brought them into the digital world where i was then able to refine further</p>

<img alt="image" src="images/watero.png" class="responsive">

<p>you may choose to keep the background of your letter forms, but in my process i chose to use the "preview" tool to remove the background</p>


<div id="digitize" class="sticky"><h3 style="color:#2B2B2B;">4 ✧ digitize°˖
</h3>
</div>

<p>you can process your font into a .ttf or .otf file using "caligraphr", a free font making website</p>
<p>caligraphr will automatically vectorize your letterforms. </p><br>
<div id="caligraphr"><a href="https://www.calligraphr.com/en/">calligraphr</a>
</div>
<img alt="image" src="images/caligraphr.png" class="responsive">
<p>if you would like your font to remain the same as it was in the previour step, simply save all your files in a folder named after your new font. then compress and share your work!</p>
